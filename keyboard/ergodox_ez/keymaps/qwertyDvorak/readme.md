This keymap makes a software-remapped Dvorak work out (so it's rougly a QWERTY mapping).
I put the programmer's braces in vertical pairs on layer 1 right above- and below- the home row.

Layer 2 is for minecraft - the left thumb does jump, because the right hand is on the mouse.

Layer 4 is a firmware-Dvorak
